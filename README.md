## Customer Acquisition and Retention Reporting App

Since we play with data everyday and we are always interested to see how our teams are performing on a daily basis, we decided to our teammates using the app.
To make it more interesting, we added charts also the ability to share charts via images.

But our long term vision was to enable anybody graph their teams performance by following a protocol of two to three Web APIs providing summary and details.

The team members working on this app were: Chintan Rita, Kushal Shah and Saurabh Shah.
